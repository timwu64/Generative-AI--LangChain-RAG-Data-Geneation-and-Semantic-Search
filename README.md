# HomeMatch Project Overview

## Introduction

"HomeMatch" aimed at personalizing the real estate search process. The application leverages the power of large language models (LLMs) and vector databases to provide clients with personalized narratives for real estate listings, catering to their unique preferences and requirements.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of "HomeMatch" is to create a seamless, engaging, and tailored property search experience by:

- **Understanding Buyer Preferences**: Capturing detailed buyer preferences in natural language, including location, budget, property type, amenities, and lifestyle choices.
- **Integrating with Vector Databases**: Utilizing vector embeddings to match properties with buyer preferences based on various criteria.
- **Personalizing Listing Descriptions**: Generating tailored property descriptions that highlight aspects relevant to the buyerâ€™s preferences without altering factual information.
- **Presenting Listings**: Showcasing personalized listings to potential buyers in a compelling and informative manner.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Setting Up the Python Application
Initialize a Python project with necessary packages such as LangChain, OpenAI's GPT, and a vector database package (e.g., ChromaDB).

### Step 2: Generating Real Estate Listings
Use an LLM to generate at least 10 diverse and realistic real estate listings. These listings will populate the database for development and testing.

### Step 3: Storing Listings in a Vector Database
Set up and configure a vector database to store real estate listings and their embeddings.

### Step 4: Building the User Preference Interface
Collect and parse buyer preferences in natural language to structure these preferences for querying the vector database.

### Step 5: Searching Based on Preferences
Implement semantic search to retrieve listings closely matching the user's requirements.

### Step 6: Personalizing Listing Descriptions
Augment the description of each retrieved listing using an LLM, emphasizing aspects that align with buyer preferences.

### Step 7: Testing
Ensure the application meets all specifications. Include example outputs demonstrating the processing of user preferences and the generation of personalized listing descriptions.

## Core Components
