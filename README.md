# HomeMatch Project

## Introduction

"HomeMatch" is an innovative application developed by "Future Homes Realty", aimed at revolutionizing the real estate industry by offering personalized experiences for each buyer. The application transforms standard real estate listings into personalized narratives, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and vector databases to meet potential buyers' unique preferences and needs.

## Challenge

The challenge involves creating an application that makes the property search process more engaging and tailored to individual preferences, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction in the real estate domain.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Setting Up the Python Application

- **Initialize a Python Project:** Start by creating a new Python project. This includes setting up a virtual environment and installing necessary packages. The key packages include LangChain, a suitable LLM library (e.g., OpenAI's GPT), and a vector database package compatible with Python (e.g., ChromaDB or LanceDB). Starter files are available if you prefer not to start from scratch.

### Installation

Ensure you have the following packages installed:

```bash
pip install langchain==0.0.305
pip install openai==0.28.1
pip install chromadb==0.4.15
pip install tiktoken
pip install langchain_core
```

### Code Setup

The project utilizes various libraries such as `openai`, `langchain`, `pandas`, etc. Below is an example snippet to get you started:

```python
import openai
from langchain import LLMChain
# Add other import statements here
```

Make sure to mount your Google Drive if you're using Google Colab for easy access to project files:

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

## Development Notes

- The project file path and other configurations should be adjusted according to your development environment.
- It is recommended to familiarize yourself with the LangChain and OpenAI libraries as they are integral to the application's functionality.
